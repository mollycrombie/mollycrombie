<h2><span>About ‘Renovation’</span></h2>
<p>
‘Renovation’ is a project combining poetic narrative with Interactive Fiction (IF) mechanics.</p>  
<p>There is no “correct” ending to Renovation. Player can conclude the story at any time resulting in different endings based on their prior actions. As such, it is intended to be played multiple times for a richer experience. Players are encouraged to take their time interacting with the world and examining the effects of their actions in the changing environment.</p> 
<p>Unlike many other IF title ‘Renovations’ takes place in a single room, eliminating the need for directional commands.
